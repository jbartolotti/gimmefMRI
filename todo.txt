make the parallel packages not required but recommended. If they are not present, fallback to numcores always = 1.


--make timecourses from brains

--edit gimmefMRI() to write/run rcode for models, and to write/run rcode for figures


Figures:
--expose config options.
--option to print command to text instead of running, to allow easy user modification

LATER
visualize distributions


maybe -- delete(or backup?) the model directory first, so that old result files don't get mistaken if running doesn't work (or model hasn't been run yet). Fn already removes the input_files directory beforehand.
